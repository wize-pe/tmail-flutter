# Configuration for Sentry

## Context
- **Team Mail** uses **Sentry** to collect and track application errors and performance issues.
- Developers need to configure environment variables for **Sentry** service to enable monitoring and debugging.
- The **backend** or **frontend** build pipeline must provide these values when deploying or running the app.

## How to config

### 1. Add environment variables for Sentry service
Create or edit the file [`sentry.env`](https://github.com/linagora/tmail-flutter/blob/master/configurations/sentry.env) with the following content:

```bash
SENTRY_DSN=<your_sentry_dsn>
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=dev
SENTRY_RELEASE=0.1.0
```

**Descriptions:**
- `SENTRY_DSN`: The unique DSN (Data Source Name) provided by Sentry, used to identify and connect your project.
- `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`: The environment name (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`) to help Sentry categorize issues by deployment.
- `SENTRY_RELEASE`: The release version of your app (e.g., `1.0.0`, `pr-1234-a1b2c3d`). Used to associate issues and source maps with a specific version.

### 2. Activate Sentry in environment file
In [`env.file`](https://github.com/linagora/tmail-flutter/blob/master/env.file), ensure the following line is present:

```bash
SENTRY_AVAILABLE=supported
```

### 3. Verification
Run the app and trigger a sample error to verify that it appears in your Sentry dashboard.
